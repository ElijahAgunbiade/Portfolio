# Aspiring Data Analyst

### Transitioning from a career in the Inventory Management and seeking a full-time role in the field of data analytics. Took a company from mass ordering and little sale with around 35% overstocking to an efficient supply position for all stocks in demand through Inventory analysis, leading to about 10% overstocking. 
#### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, Tableau, Spreadsheet, Statistics, Machine Learning, and Modeling

## Projects
### Factors impacting Employee Retention Rate Discovery with Random Forest Learning Model
[Publication](https://elijahagunbiade.github.io/HR-Salifort-Motors/)

Developed a machine learning model to identify qualities of employees who are most likely to leave the company using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better understandings of why employees are leaving the company at such rate and what factors to consider to prevent it. The proposed method provides a learning model with the ability to detect employees in the company with good potential of leaving the company with an 86% F1 score, while also providing insights on how to prevent such situation in the first place.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
